Your own chat line now appears on your screen as it is sent, as the recipients see it, tagged
with who it went to. `TextBackgroundColor` under `[Options]` in `sun.ini` draws a colour behind
every glyph of the message list and its editor: `12` is the black box the CnCNet client's chat
background option writes, and `0`, the default, draws none. A name is now followed by a space
before the text.

Iran wrote the echo, from the code he wrote for Red Alert, and dkeeton the message background.
CCHyper and tomsons26 are credited for the Vinifera versions of both.
