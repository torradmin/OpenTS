Saved games now live in a `Saved Games` folder, beside the game or inside the user data
directory when one is named. Every save, load, listing and deletion names that folder, and
the settings the random map generator saves keep to it too.

Saves made by earlier builds sit beside the game, or in the user data directory when one is
named, and are no longer listed; moving the files into `Saved Games` restores them.

After a load, the campaign difficulty now comes from the save rather than the menu setting.

Rampastring is credited for the ts-patches patch of the same name.
